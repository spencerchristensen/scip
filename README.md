A collection of [Livebooks](https://livebook.dev) I am using to savor *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman.

I originally read SCIP 10 years ago when I first began to "study" programming. A second reading is proving very enjoyable as there is much that I missed having not had the proper experience or context through which to *understand* their work. 

The first reading was educational, like reading a textbook. This one is recreational, as one savors the rightness of poetry. 

Examples and exercises are a mix of Scheme and Elixir, using the former for illustration and the latter for evaluation. Exercises are not exhaustive but limited to those I felt demanded a deeper understanding.
